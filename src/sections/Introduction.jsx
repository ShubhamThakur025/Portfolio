            <p className="text-justify text-sm text-slate-700 mb-5">I'm a computer science engineering student at <a target="_blank" className='underline underline-offset-2' href="https://www.chitkarauniversity.edu.in/">Chitkara University</a> - HP, India. I am currently enrolled in a 4-year software product development specialization program with <a target="_blank" className='underline underline-offset-2'  href="https://kalvium.com/">Kalvium</a>. Meanwhile, I'm also developing my technical and professional prowess through internships. <br/> <br/>
            My interests range from UI/UX designing to building actual products using web-dev. I am proficient in the MERN stack and have strong knowledge of C++ and Python. Recently, Iâ€™ve started exploring Java and Scala to expand my skill set further. <br/> <br/>
            Beyond technology, I am interested in everything that involves creativity - Literature, Painting, and Music. Yes, and I love reading history too.ðŸ˜„</p>
